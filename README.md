## Awesome config
It was made from copy cat config. looks okay.

## notes.sh
A script for note taking in vim and terminal.

Setup       
        check if the file is made executable or not. If not mark it executable
        Paste it inside usr/local/bin.

That's it for running in terminal 
For running in vim 
        add a key bind for !notes.sh


I am sure this not the best script but i made it and works fine so i have no problems with it

#### vimrc
Vim rc for web development
