# DOT FILES

#### Dependencies : kitty, polybar, tint2, rofi


## Awesome config
It was made from copy cat config. looks okay.
To make it work:
            
            cd dotfiles
            cp ./awesome ~/.config/

#### notes.sh
A script for note taking in vim and terminal.

Setup:   
      check if the file is made executable or not. If not mark it executable   
      
      Paste it inside usr/local/bin.

That's it for running in terminal 
For running in vim             
      
      add a key bind for !notes.sh
